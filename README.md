# Pothole Detection Application and Research Paper


## Overview

We propose an efficient and easily scalable approach for the **detection and mapping** of potholes. It as a **Deep Learning** based **two-fold** detection system that uses the **Camera, and, the Accelerometer and Gyroscope** sensors present in our Smartphones. The aim of this project is to **mitigate** the financial and human **losses** incurred every year from accidents caused by potholes by mapping the same and **informing the right authorities**.

## Introduction

Potholes have been prevalent in places with high population density and poor road management services. Since then, they have been responsible for a huge chunk of road accidents that take place across the globe every year. Our application with its two-fold detection systems minimizes the chances of a pothole going undetected and is easily deployable over a smartphone. 



The system we propose utilizes the following two methods of detection:
